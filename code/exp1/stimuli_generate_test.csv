Stimuli
The man forgot to do his homework
She likes apples
The man draws the image
There is a cave below the earth
The cat chases the mouse
I have a car
She does the work
The boy is playing soccer
Jim showed the man his license
Steve went to New York
The kids go to the mall
The man has forgotten to do his homework
